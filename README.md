# Python-Dashboard
This dashboard using reactive callbacks to plot gas and water data based on data and time. Please note that a lot of styling Assets and overall skeleton was built from a suite of Dash Sample Apps (https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-financial-report). I added the support for reactive callbacks as well as tools to filter the data.
